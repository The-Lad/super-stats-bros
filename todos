TODO
# MUST
Predict tier list model
Fix error when clicking on same point as before, but after updating plot - its because it's still an 'unclick' - example: error with big circle (say, on Luigi), then hit Group by, then unhit, then hit same (ie Luigi) and grays out
Commented code
Fix normal dt sounds
Integrate get_sounds.R into compile_data.R

Fix switching issues
Add color backgrounds

# WANT
!!!Display data table as Ultimate character select screen!!!
Fix non-ability to repeat two keyseq in a row
Tier list model functionality in app
Data table can jump to tier icon for tiers
READY, GO on start, GAME on stop. HARD
Time range for tournament_win_freq - MATT
Lower hover-off range -SHARN
Improve the hovering. Maybe make it so that as you hover over a point it slightly increases - SHARN 
Click button to swap x and y axes
Possible character select sound in background
On Omitted, show Char+gang as POKEMON TRAINER, and PopoNana as ICs
Add other songs to keyboard easter egg
Moving colour background for roster DT as in https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/communicating-with-js.html using Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler

# POSSIBLES
Very slight jitter 
Modify get_sounds script to move files out of nested structure
Tier list model runs and predicts on character of user's design (incl photo they add- can't use usage, tournament etc in this case)
Head to head comparison feature
Series fighters comparison (plotting points in clusters, plotting mean & sds of stats)
Top Trumps style game

# DONE
Pacman's ultimate sound file
Fix click on bottom row of roster dt
Add sounds to roster
Disable click on black boxes for roster dt (this was a lot of work!)
Fixed circle hiding image markers
Get tier list data
Option for icons as pics
Disable x and y var being the same
DLC character announcer
Set a zoom limit to prevent the singularity from consuming us all
Zooming in w/ icons as points without zooming in on the actual poins is quite glitchy (CANT REPRODUCE)
Show plot omissions
A lot of plots may be missing Pokemon Trainer as there are Squirtle, Ivysaur and Charizard. Fix in future- get Squirtle, Ivysaur, Charizard but NA them for all that Trainer is non-NA for.
(Rest of announcer clips
