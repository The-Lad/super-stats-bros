TODO
# MUST
Get tier list data
Predict tier list model
Fix data table for tiers
Fix data table for images as markers once clicked (circle)
Fix error with circle lingering
Fix error with big circle (say, on Luigi), then hit Group by, then unhit, then hit same (ie Luigi) and grays out
Fix circle hiding image markers
Fix error when same thing selected twice
Set a zoom limit to prevent the singularity from consuming us all
Zooming in w/ icons as points without zooming in on the actual poins is quite glitchy

# WANT
Local icons working
Tier list model functionality in app
Improve the hovering. Maybe make it so that as you hover over a point it slightly increases in size?

# POSSIBLES
Tier list model runs and predicts on character of user's design (incl photo they add- can't use usage, tournament etc in this case)
Head to head comparison
Option for icons as pics
Series fighters comparison (plotting points in clusters, plotting mean & sds of stats)
Top Trumps style game

# DONE
