TODO
# MUST
Get tier list data
Predict tier list model
Fix data table for images as markers once clicked (circle)
Fix error with circle lingering (where?)
Disable x and y var being the same
Fix error when clicking on same point as before, but after updating plot - its because it's still an 'unclick' - example: error with big circle (say, on Luigi), then hit Group by, then unhit, then hit same (ie Luigi) and grays out
Set a zoom limit to prevent the singularity from consuming us all
Zooming in w/ icons as points without zooming in on the actual poins is quite glitchy
Commented code


# WANT
!!!Display data table as Ultimate character select screen!!!
Local icons working
Tier list model functionality in app
Data table can jump to tier icon for tiers

# POSSIBLES

Head to head comparison feature
Series fighters comparison (plotting points in clusters, plotting mean & sds of stats)
Top Trumps style game

# DONE
