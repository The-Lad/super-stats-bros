# MUST
Get tier list data
Predict tier list model
Fix error when clicking on same point as before, but after updating plot - its because it's still an 'unclick' - example: error with big circle (say, on Luigi), then hit Group by, then unhit, then hit same (ie Luigi) and grays out
Commented code



# WANT
!!!Display data table as Ultimate character select screen!!!
Local icons working
Tier list model functionality in app
Data table can jump to tier icon for tiers
Super Smash bros font for Super Stats Bros
Rest of announcer clips
Time range for tournament_win_freq
Improve the hovering. Maybe make it so that as you hover over a point it slightly increases 

# POSSIBLES
Modify get_sounds script to move files out of nested structure
Tier list model runs and predicts on character of user's design (incl photo they add- can't use usage, tournament etc in this case)
Head to head comparison feature
Series fighters comparison (plotting points in clusters, plotting mean & sds of stats)
Top Trumps style game

# DONE
Fixed circle hiding image markers
Option for icons as pics
Disable x and y var being the same
DLC character announcer
Set a zoom limit to prevent the singularity from consuming us all
Zooming in w/ icons as points without zooming in on the actual poins is quite glitchy (CANT REPRODUCE)
Show plot omissions
A lot of plots may be missing Pokemon Trainer as there are Squirtle, Ivysaur and Charizard. Fix in future- get Squirtle, Ivysaur, Charizard but NA them for all that Trainer is non-NA for.
