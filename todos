# MUST
Get tier list data
Predict tier list model
Fix data table for tiers
Fix data table for images as markers once clicked (circle)
Fix error with circle lingering (where?)
Disable x and y var being the same
Fix error when clicking on same point as before, but after updating plot - its because it's still an 'unclick'
  example Fix error with big circle (say, on Luigi), then hit Group by, then unhit, then hit same (ie Luigi) and grays out
