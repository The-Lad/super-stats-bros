TODO
# MUST
Fix error when clicking on same point as before, but after updating plot - its because it's still an 'unclick' - example: error with big circle (say, on Luigi), then hit Group by, then unhit, then hit same (ie Luigi) and grays out
Commented code
React to omitted to remove characters from selected
Loading circle for roster dt
X sound when no sound available for char

# WANT
Integrate get_sounds.R into compile_data.R
Fix non-ability to repeat two keyseq in a row
Data table can jump to tier icon for tiers
READY, GO on start, GAME on stop. HARD
Time range for tournament_win_freq - MATT
Lower hover-off range -SHARN
Improve the hovering. Maybe make it so that as you hover over a point it slightly increases - SHARN 
Possible character select sound in background
On Omitted, show Char+gang as POKEMON TRAINER, and PopoNana as ICs
Add other songs to keyboard easter egg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MWl7wZtFKI


# POSSIBLES

DLC character announcer
Set a zoom limit to prevent the singularity from consuming us all
Zooming in w/ icons as points without zooming in on the actual poins is quite glitchy (CANT REPRODUCE)
Show plot omissions
A lot of plots may be missing Pokemon Trainer as there are Squirtle, Ivysaur and Charizard. Fix in future- get Squirtle, Ivysaur, Charizard but NA them for all that Trainer is non-NA for.
